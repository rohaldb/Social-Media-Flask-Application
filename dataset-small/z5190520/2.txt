message: Dear Jeff Yan (1st Year),\n\nI love the way you sneak a peek at me when you're talking with your friends. The way you glance at me with your luscious brown eyes, and give me a cheeky wink. The way you smell like UNSW's very own haram HSP. The way you get 100 LG's on the beach. I want to know you better, hmu on messenger? Maybe I can be your 101st girl on the beach ;)

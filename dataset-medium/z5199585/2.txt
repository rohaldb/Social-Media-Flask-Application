message: To the Indian girl in my MATH1131 class. I think, wait actually no, I am falling for you. The way you brush your fringe away from your forehead. The way you squint your eyes just to see what is on the screen. I think your name is Ruchi. All I think about is you and sing this to myself :\nHum tere bin ab reh nahi sakte, tere bina kya wajood mera?\nLooking forward to seeing you again real soon.\nYours truly,\nmadly,\ndeeply in love

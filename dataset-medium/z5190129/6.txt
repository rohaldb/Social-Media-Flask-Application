message: This isn't much of a love letter but I just want to say as a first year I really find Anna Cheng inspiring < 3\n\nI'd also want to be involved with startups one day so I'm glad to see people like her at UNSW working with established startups. She seems  incredibly hard working and well accomplished - motivating me to work on my own personal self development.\n\nKeep up the great work Anna! :)

message: To the cute boy at red Centre during stuvac.. You are always working on your designs in the computer labs at level two.. Your hair is fluffy and eloquent, and with your scruffy beard so subtle but yet so ferocious.. I think you go by the name 'nev'.. How bout we go for coffee and let me feel that beard of yours ;-)

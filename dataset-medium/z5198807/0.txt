message: To the Middle Eastern (Indian?) invigilator in my Chem1011 midexam at Clancy auditorium today, I think I failed my test. I can't stop looking at your handsome face and hot chest. Your butt is really nice too in those black jeans. (I'm not a lady. Sorry if I got you excited for the first few lines there.) Still! XOXOXOX

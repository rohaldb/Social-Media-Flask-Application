message: To the one and only Sharon in my heart, when I first laid my eyes upon the beauty and radiance that is you, at the Project Hope stall at o-week, I knew in that very instant that you would be the only person that I would ever fall in love for the rest of my life. I would shower you with rose petals, hugs and kisses for as long as I am alive, for I have already donated my heart to your happiness. I just wish that I could have the honour to spend the rest of my life with you, because no one would make me happier than you. To Sharon, my one and only. Your secret admirer.

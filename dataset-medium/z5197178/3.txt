message: To the gorgeous blonde girl with blue wool sweater and peach skirt who spend this Thursday night (April 21st) at Study Lounge Main Lib.\nI just can't take my eyes off of you. Your blue eyes are amazingly hypnotised me. Your pink lips is like a sweet strawberry. Your smile is so addictive!\nIf you're a weed, what kind of grinder are you using? Cause you're extra fine!\n\nThe only reason that I didn't hit on you tonight is because we are in the Study Lounge.\nI promise if I ever see you again outside the library I will definitely say hi!\nGirl, do you smoke pot? Cause weed look good together.\n\nCurly tall guy with green leaf socks who sit across from you.\n22 April 2016 01:00am

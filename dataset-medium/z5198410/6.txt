message: Dear M. Y.,\n\nI got dragged to Medrevue last night by my friends. Wasn't even sure I wanted to be there until you came on stage. Never have I seen such presence of character. When you spoke, waves of energy emanated out and shook me to my core. I'd given up on UNSW boys but you have rekindled my thirst. The way that the lights reflected off your well-chiselled, well made-up face makes me want to sit on it.\nI left moist.\n\nComing again tonight... ;)

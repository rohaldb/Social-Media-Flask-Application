message: To a burmese girl- Pwint from Mechanical Engineering,\n\nI am falling into your smile, you laugh, your kindness, your look. I haven't seen this kind of innocent girl in my entire life. I am studying Aero and if i have a chance, i want to be your study partner. The reason I come to school every day is to see your bright smile. \nI want to request that don't show your bright smile to everyone and I hope you can notice me anyway.\n\nCoffee Sometimes?

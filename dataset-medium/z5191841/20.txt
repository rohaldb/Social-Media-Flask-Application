message: To that friend I go to math lectures with, I am so thankful for having met such an intelligent and patient friend who helps me whenever I get stuck on a question but I absolutely hate it when your other friend comes along and distracts you from me. I wish I could tell you how much you mean to me but i'm not sure if you feel the same way as me...

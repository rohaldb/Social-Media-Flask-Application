message: This is a message forewarning anyone who ever liked someone and kept it to themselves... don't do it. I liked someone, but I kept giving myself reasons not to tell them. I didn't want to get hurt myself, but more importantly, I didn't want our friendship to be ruined... I had never really felt so close to anyone before. We would always talk, laugh, joke around etc. the usual sort of things, and I never felt like I was an annoyance when I would randomly pop by and say 'hey'. But there came a time where I decided I was going to just tell them how I feel (felt?), it just seemed like the right thing to do, I was ready, and I was beginning to think of the best time to say it. I just wanted to lay the cards on the table and let the chips fall where they may... well... I started talking to them, and then they told me of this 'great news!'... they have started dating someone. I guess the most difficult thing for me is that I had made the conscious decision to tell them how I feel (felt?)... and, even more so is the fact that suddenly every single past opportunity I'd had to tell them how I felt came flooding back to my mind and suddenly I started feeling the fool. Don't waste those opportunity's, because they are not endless, they are not limitless, they do run out. And when they do, you end up feeling like shit, writing stupid 'confessions' or whatever trying to make sense of the emotions which churn from happiness and ecstasy for them and a mix of sorrow, self-loathing and generally feeling like you're gonna puke... I'm open to suggestions to get over this feeling... but yeah... if you like someone, and don't want to feel like shit when you find out that they've started dating, just tell them! After all YOLO.

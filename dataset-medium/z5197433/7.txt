message: It's been years since we talked, months since the last of our memories had faded, and days since I thought about you.\nNot that we see each other any more, and we promised to let it go,\nbut those few rare moments I've accidentally caught you walking by, made it harder for me to stop caring.\nI suppose we got on with our lives just fine, chasing our own dreams and sharing our successes with the ones we love.\nAt least I know I am busy doing that, although I just can't help but ask.\nHow have you been? Is life treating you kindly? Are you happy?\n\n- the boy who promised to keep a little piece of us in the corner of his heart

message: To that stunning girl in my comp1917 and math1131 lectures, I think your friends call you Farhana??? \nI am mesmerized by ur beauty and all I can do is stare at you instead of pay attention. I love the way you put ur pen in between ur lips when you go on your phone during the lecture.\nWatching you walk in late today in the math lecture made my heart race. Please continue to come to all the lectures for the sake of being able to stare at you.\nLove, ur not so secret admirer.

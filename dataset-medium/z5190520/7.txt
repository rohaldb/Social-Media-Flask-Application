message: To the drunk rowdy girls at Darling Harbour on the night of Thursday (14th July). There were like 5-6 of you and I helped out by taking a pic of you girls at that white lit blossom tree area and then we went Pokemon Hunting for a bit. Sorry about leaving you so suddenly, I went to meet up with my mates hahaha. I still got the other picture that one of you asked for, but I didnt get your names or numbers. Hit me up for some Pokemon Go! Also so I can send you the picture.

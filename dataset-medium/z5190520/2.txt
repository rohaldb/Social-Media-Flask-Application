message: To the beautiful girl at Max Brenner yesterday. I paid for your drink because of the eftpos minimum, and I'm hoping that in return, I can take you out for a drink of the romantic kind. I hope that I can be worthy enough for you. I can be the PointlessBlog to your Zoella anyday. After doing some research (or facebook stalking), I think your friends call you Casiolie. And I want to make you my ravioli. Forever yours... your (not so) secret admirer from Maxie's... xo.

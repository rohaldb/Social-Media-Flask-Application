message: To #12379,\nI know that itâ€™s probably just a coincidence but I might be who you're talking about.\nIf I am, then I'm really really sorry, my feelings for you never changed, just that we never got to talk much and I figured that you didn't seem interested so I thought it better to not bother you. \nBut looks like I could have misinterpreted that... So yeah, if it's you N, then maybe add me on fb? Or I'll try to talk to you next time I see you at uni (though we don't seem to see each other around much anymore)

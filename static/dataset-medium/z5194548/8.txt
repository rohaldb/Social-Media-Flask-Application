message: To the Asian girl with glasses wearing a pink fluffy/furry sweater and black yoga pants catching the 4:20pm-ish train on platform 18 on Sunday, 26th of June. I regret not following you up the stairs and sitting next to you. Would you give me the chance to take you to a movie or lunch sometime next week?\n\nP.S. I saw you walk up the platform 19 side, and you decided to stand infront of me. YOU. MADE. MY. HEART. STOP. Who knew I would see you again. Can I see you again?  ;)\n\nP.P.S. I posted on here because I am not sure if you are from UNSW. \n\nFrom W.T, the Asian boy with the glasses

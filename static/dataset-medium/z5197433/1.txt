message: To Gustavo Luis, I'm your secret admirer who wrote the love letter back then. I tried to find you in Red Centre and all possible buildings where they hold Math classes, but I failed. I hope you'll strip to your undies one time at the Quad lawn. Please announce it so I can have the pleasure to watch and fantasize.

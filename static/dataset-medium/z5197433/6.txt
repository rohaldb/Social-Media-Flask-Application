message: To the guy in front of me in the BABS1201 lecture today (wednesday)... I only saw the side of your head but I think it's safe to assume that overall you're pretty good looking, possibly even hot. Thanks to your near-furious typing I noticed that you have a ridiculous amount of icons on your laptop's taskbar or whatever the Apple equivalent is, and I relate to that. You also had some nice stubble going on which complemented your lovely dark hair that you pushed back at least once. I also noticed you immediately take the chance to rest your head on your desk thing as soon as Louise began playing another video in her lecture despite how short the video was, which I found kinda funny. Keep up the good work.

message: So I kinda like this guy I used to go to school with. I never really had a chance to get to know him at school, and now he has been at UNSW for a few years and I'm over at USYD, so I never see him or casually bump into each other on campus. I'm just hoping we will see each other at a mutual friends birthday or something. I don't even know if he follows this page. But hoping he may see this, think back to the girls at school and realise how perfect I am for him. Or if you know who I am, just send me a message :)

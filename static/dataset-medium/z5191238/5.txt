message: To the guy I met at OPM on 29/4/16, \n\nI was already tipsy when we talked last night so I can't remember much.. I only remember that your name was Kevin, from Hong Kong, 4th year law student who fast-tracked their degree, 24 years old. I was too scared to ask you for your number or FB.. sorry hahaha\n\nI would love to talk to you again, maybe we can get a coffee someday?

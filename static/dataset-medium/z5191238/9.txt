message: To that med girl who gets all the guys,\n\nI was heartbroken when i didnt get tagged in the post and all the other guys did... But even though i know i am not the one in your eyes, I get syncope whenever our eyes meet. When u walk into ww and beam me a giant smile, i wish you could hear the palpitations and atrial flutters you give me and diagnose my love. I dream of us being in the same cs group so we can perform physical examinations on each other. Oh, A. You are so mean yet so sweet to me.

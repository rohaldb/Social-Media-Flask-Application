message: To the Asian/Chilean girl studying fine arts, Naomi Chilcott,\nYour booty is lush and firm,\nYour hair is silky like the Arabian breeze,\nI love the way you swivel your hips,\nSometimes I wish I could be the cartridge paper in which you draw upon, or the pencil you use in your perky fingers..\nI like to watch you at your Tuesday UNSW Modernity lecture.\nYou're my glow-stick of love, and my bucket of sunshine.\nI love you

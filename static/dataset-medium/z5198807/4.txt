message: Yesterday (4th May) around 6:07 PM, i was passing around the UNSW gym finishing my workout, and the way between gym and Mamak village i saw two Asian girls passing through. And at the moment i saw her face, my feet just stopped and i had to look back again. Now my most regretful time in my whole life is, I didn't run back and ask for her name. I really want to see her again. Please help me people

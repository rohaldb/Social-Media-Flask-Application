message: We walked past each other and instantly smiled around 3 last Friday just around physics lawn. You were wearing a black hoodie and I was wearing a monkey sweatshirt. I was rushing to class but I should've said hi.\n\nFind me again next Thursday around physics lawn at lunchtime (1-2) if you want another smile!\n\n- Monkeyboy

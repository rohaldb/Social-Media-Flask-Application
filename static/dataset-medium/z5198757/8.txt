message: I took my girlfriend today to get a holy HSP from King Kebabs. It took over a hour to get to the holy land, once we arrived she ordered for me. I stood there in disbelief, thinking what is she doing. \nHowever, it was this moment that had me in shock. She got the order perfect. "Two large mixed meat HSPs, with cheese between the meat and chips." Just the way I like it. Then the moment came where the brother from King Kebabs asked what sauce would you like. It felt like these 2 minutes of my life went on forever, I thought to myself no one can be this perfect...she is going to order dingo sauce. Then it happened, everyone said it happens when you least expect it. She looked at me, gave me a smile I will never forget for the rest of my life and said "BBQ, Chilli and Garlic please."  I got goosebumps all over my arms and legs. I knew at this moment.... I fell in love. \n\nSee, I go to USYD but she goes to UNSW. I'm here to confess my love for you my sweet tinkerbell.\nI love you, and I will ALWAYS allow you to order my food from now on. <3

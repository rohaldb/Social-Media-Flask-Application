message: There's this Indian girl I like, she's really good looking, often or not, cute in the way she talks. She pats my head a lot coz its really spiky. She also teases me a lot, giving me all these mixed feelings. I love seeing her presence in societies, like Pokemon Society, Disney Society, as well as getting involved as exec. of multiple societies, since it shows that you're really willing to go out there and do something for the uni community, instead of just studying all the time.\n\nI feel worried to ask her out coz she might think I'm a creep or that my parents and friends will give me so much shame. I'm a Chinese person and I have super Asian parents :S

message: Dear Paolo, you're gorgeous and i'm definitely going to approach you but not until 5th year because i couldn't bear being a law class with you if you reject me. Although i realised up until now i haven't even considered the obvious and totally likely fact that you're taken. Please god, someone tell me he's single. I know this seems like the creepy route but we have no mutual friends so I have no other way in!

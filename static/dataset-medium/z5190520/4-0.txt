message: Gods! If you're going to go down, make sure it'll be to Globe Lawn tomorrow for our free BBQ (with fasting options) at 1pm. Godly Hellsoc members may sustain themselves with as much food as they wish, ABSOLUTELY FREE! For those mere mortals who have yet to become a Hellsoc member, sign up on the spot (petty $5 membership fee) and take advantage of all Hellsoc BBQ's throughout the year! \nBYO grapes

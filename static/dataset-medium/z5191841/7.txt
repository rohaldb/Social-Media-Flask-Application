message: To the love of my life,\nWe've been together through thick and thin, you've always been there for me whenever I needed you and even when I didn't. You're so very special to me and I appreciate all the times you've filled me up when I was running low. You're so saucy and hot. So perfect... Even when my parents and friends didn't understand our love. It doesn't matter, we understand it and thats what matters. Halal snack pack, I love you with all my heart.

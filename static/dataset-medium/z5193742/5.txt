message: Dearest K,\n\nFrom the moment I was introduced to you I was completely enthralled. I could get lost for an eternity in your eyes. You could lead me anywhere, because when I was at one of my lowest points, you came. At university and in life, it's sink or swim, and I was drowning. And you may not know it, but you saved me. If you didn't come around, I would still be in that place, so for that I thank you. You don't realise what you mean to me, but maybe one day I'll tell you the story.

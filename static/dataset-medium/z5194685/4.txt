message: There's a girl in my Tuesday morning FINS1613 lecture that I have been eye-ing for a while. She sits with the same people around the mid-back of the lecture room... She's quite the charm, looks half caste (quite pale) with nice legs. A few weeks ago she kept talking about how she loved Krispy Kreme doughnuts and couldn't wait for them to arrive. I couldn't get her name, but her friend next to her called her Min/Nin?\n\nI will wait for the day you will notice me and I would love to buy you a dozen Krispy Kremes. <3

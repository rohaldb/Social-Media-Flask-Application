message: Dear Joe Chen\nI see you at ASOC and Im really attracted to your quiet, aloof nature and your mysterious aura is a real turn on. Like youre a lone wolf alpha male. Are you single? Im interested in tall asian men plus your shiny black hair is tops. I love anime and penguins and I think well have mountains to talk about\n-With love, the short black haired girl in ASOC

message: It has been two days since our first meeting, N. I have no interest in anyone for 4 years until I met you. I can't forget your cute smile. I feel that it is very weird, but it seems that I enjoy it. However, I don't have any courage to approach you. I'm just a single, shy and ugly man. Ok, I think I have a psychological disorder. I need to stop this.\n\nYour secret admirer,\nL
